# Sentiment_Analysis_Of_Financial_News

### What is this?
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model for Financial News. The core idea is to automatically determine the emotional tone (positive, negative, or neutral) conveyed within financial headlines and articles. This can be incredibly valuable for investors, analysts, and anyone looking to gauge market sentiment from textual data, providing insights that might influence investment decisions or market outlook.
